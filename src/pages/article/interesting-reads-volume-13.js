                    <Paragraph><OutLink href="https://twitter.com/marcelpociot" color="blue">Marcel Pociot</OutLink> was productive in the last couple of months and created <OutLink href="https://beyondco.de/docs/expose/introduction" color="blue">Expose</OutLink>, free open-source tunneling service (ngrok alternative) written in pure PHP. It allows you to share your local websites with others via the internet.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>He also created <OutLink href="https://laravelplayground.com/" color="blue">Laravel Playground</OutLink> - a free-to-use service that allows you to try out Laravel code (and all its features) directly in your browser.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>I greatly admire people who can create and deliver products in such rapid succession. I'd be happy with myself if I was able to create and release one of my side projects. This is why this year I'm trying to work on smaller projects and tools and get my self in "release" state of mind.</Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph>Learn how <OutLink href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" color="green">Adam Wathan</OutLink> created Tailwind CSS and turned a helper library from his graveyard side projects into a multi-million dollar business. Succinct but inspiring as you never know where your possibility to make a "dent in the universe" lays :-)</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>And while we're talking about Tailwind CSS - they recently released a plugin (called <OutLink href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography" color="green">Tailwind Typography</OutLink>) that provides typographic styling for vanilla HTML you don't control (like from a markdown or a CMS). A lot of users were complaining that Tailwind CSS was hard to use for CMS content (to me it was the only downside to it) and now they've addressed it, and they've fixed it pretty elegantly if I may say so.</Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph>Although I'm not a JavaScript developer, the title seems like a clickbait but my curiosity got better of me ü§® There really are a few features that I've never heard or used before which seems useful and will definitely come in handy. Did you hear or used all of them?</Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph>As the title says it is a simple React error boundary component that can be used to handle all errors thrown during React's lifecycles. Plus it has a pretty nifty helper function for handling async errors. What are the error boundaries I hear you ask? Well, take a look at this <OutLink href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-react-error-boundary-to-handle-errors-in-react" color="red">Kent C. Dodds article</OutLink> for in detail explanation.</Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph>Cool article with a lot of amazing tips for writing. I already included some of the tips in this volume. Can you guess which I've used? :-) <OutLink href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" color="blue">Hemingway App</OutLink> (suggested here) is amazing as well - it calculates your text readability and suggests how to make it more so.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>It even suggests replacing some more complicated words with their easier to understand replacements. This is strange because in my writing I wanted to expand my vocabulary and used a wider range of words to appear more knowledgeable - when in doing so I might have turned off some non-native speakers (one of the tips from the article ;-)).</Paragraph>

Besides navigating through the story of how that came to be, he also gives us "nuggets" he picked along the way and some of them might be helpful for just about anybody.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>Caleb is extremely productive lately (<OutLink href="https://laravel-livewire.com/" color="yellow">Laravel Livewire</OutLink>, <OutLink href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine" color="yellow">AlpineJs</OutLink>, and <OutLink href="https://github.com/calebporzio/sushi" color="yellow">Sushi</OutLink> to name a few of my favorites) and his success story is an inspiration for how to be (financially) successful when creating open-source software without resorting to creating a SaaS product.</Paragraph>
