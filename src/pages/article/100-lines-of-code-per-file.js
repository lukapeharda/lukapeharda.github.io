                    <Paragraph>I had a class that was 133 lines long and I want to see whether I can get it under 100. As the class was already "doing one thing" it didn't make sense to refactor it and split it into two files.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>First to go were the comments ðŸ˜€ Method docblocks were replaced with proper type declarations and return types. To preserve the readability, variable and method names had to be changed to be self-explanatory although a bit longer. Conditionals were extracted into separate methods.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>Multiple simple <em>IFs</em> were combined into one, which did hurt readability a bit but it saved 5 lines ðŸ˜€</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>Somewhat duplicated code was extracted and parametrized which allowed me to reuse methods in several locations.</Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>And I got to 99 lines ðŸš€</Paragraph>

                    <Divider></Divider>

                    <Paragraph>I was skeptical about this requirement when I started but now I see its benefits. It makes you think about your code a bit more and forces you to make it more readable while also removing clutter from your files. And as strange as this may sound, it was fun doing it ðŸ˜†</Paragraph>
