			<title>Book Recommendation: The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change your Life and Achieve Real Happiness by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga</title>
			<link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked</link>
			<description><![CDATA[This book is being called "Marie Condo for your brain" and I find this comparison very suitable :-) Two thoughts really resonated with me. The first one is "freedom is being disliked by other people" and the other is "happines is the feeling of contribution". So simple yet so deep.]]></description>

			<title>Book Recommendation: The Dark Forest by Liu Cixin</title>
			<link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest</link>
			<description><![CDATA[The whole Three-Body triology is amazing and definitely worth reading and one of the better SF series in my opinion. "The Dark Forest" (second book in the series) contains one of the most memorable definition of love: "For the majority of people, what they love exists only in the imagination. The object of their love is not the man or woman of reality, but what he or she is like in their imagination. The person in reality is just a template used for the creation of this dream lover. Eventually, they find out the differences between their dream lover and the template. If they can get used to those differences, then they can be together. If not, they split up. It's as simple as that."]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Derek Sivers is the bomb! He gives so many great nuggets here you'll have to listen to it at least twice. From his life philosophy, through book recommendations, to some intimate life details in a calm and rational matter.

			<title>Podcast Recommendation: The Knowledge Project Podcast #100 with Matt Mullenweg</title>
			<link>https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/matt-mullenweg/</link>
			<description><![CDATA[Most Farnam Street (The Knowledge Project) podcast episodes are awesome but the one with Matt Mullenweg from WordPress stands out for me. They discuss remote work (Matt rather calls it distributed) and different levels of it. Matt's saying "Words create reality" was something that moved me unexpectedly and was real food for thought. And I can not get over how soothing Matt Mullenweg voice sounds :-)]]></description>
