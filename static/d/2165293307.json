Its simple framework of challenging directly and caring personally is really powerful. I've thought I was being radically candor when I was obnoxuiously aggressive and by reading this amazing book I now know the difference and how to progress from undesired behaviour to desired one.","recommendationYear":2020}},{"node":{"url":"https://amzn.to/3fFlNZe","title":"Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur","author":"Derek Sivers","description":"This short book (which if you put your mind to it can be read in a couple of hours) is so filled with great advice that I implore you to read it multiple times. Derek Sivers, the creator of CD Baby is describing his success and his failures in a series of short lessons where each one has a great takeaway. Some of the best quotes for me are \"Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working\" and \"No 'yes'. Either 'Hell yeah!' or 'no.'\"","recommendationYear":2020}},{"node":{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805","title":"Never Split The Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It","author":"Chris Voss","description":"One of the best books on the subject of negotiation with a lot of examples of how to use the knowledge in your daily life.

The principle of B = MAP (behavior = motivation * ability * prompt) is explained in several ways in the book and the methods accompanying it are brilliant. There are 300 tiny habits and the end of the book to get inspired with and, they are very useful.","recommendationYear":2020}},{"node":{"url":"https://amzn.to/35YJ9DS","title":"Atomic Habits","author":"James Clear","description":"Excellent book for those who want to learn how to form good habits easily or break bad ones.
